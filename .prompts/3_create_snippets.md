We donâ€™t need the entire codebase for the chapter (eg boilerplate error handling, edge cases, security, etc.). Instead present the core components within an extensible framework. A seperate GitHub repository is available for the complete implementation later.

Cut scope by referencing builtin and mainstream python open source modules (eg SQLite versus multi-node SQL cluster). The audience is me a senior engineer with extensive experience.

Using the project's documents to determine what classes, concepts, and technical artifacts already exist. Reference and derive from those resources instead of repeating them.

Output the following three artifacts:

1. First table of code snippets/artifacts/resources in order by and their size, purpose, benefit, is generic/redundant, and better approach columns.

2. Evaluate determine if: a. there's low-value resources using the table. b. Which of the better approach values should be used and why? c. Focus on improving the reader's goal: "learning _how to perform_ the learning objectives -- not _about the topic_" (e.g., teach me to fish, don't tell me fish swim in water). d. Are there additional jinga SDK level constructs and APIs that further strengthen our story and connect it back to book objectives (see ToC in project documents)?

3. Update the first artifact using the assessment results. Loop until no additional high-value/actionable feedback is available. Don't exceed five iterations.

When finished iterating. Stop and think about the final table produced. Output the code snippets/resources into an artifact with number, names, descriptions followed by concise python implementation of the main idea(s).
